# [Hyperparameter optimisation blueprint](<The future with AI (8).pdf>)
by Cristian Lungu

[Notebook](<Hyperparamter optimisations blueprint.ipynb>)

Join us as we explore the blueprint for hyperparameter optimization in machine learning. This talk covers tools like TensorFlow and Optuna, thorough preparatory steps including data handling and baseline modeling, and approaches from grid search to Bayesian optimization. Learn to effectively utilize algorithms such as Gaussian Processes and Tree-structured Parzen Estimators to fine-tune your models, enhancing performance and ensuring robustness. Perfect for ML professionals aiming to master their model's efficiency and accuracy.
