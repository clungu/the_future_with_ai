# What to discuss on Discord

## Relevant Submissions

We welcome content that would captivate the interest of proficient ML researchers.
This encompasses a broad range of topics, not limited to AI and ML. Essentially,
if it satisfies intellectual curiosity about the technological future, it's on-topic.

## Irrelevant Submissions

Avoid submitting the majority of stories related to politics, crime, sports, or celebrity news unless they highlight a
novel and intriguing occurrence. Videos of mishaps, catastrophes, or adorable animals, and typical TV news subjects are
generally not pertinent.


## Title Formatting

Refrain from using tactics like uppercase letters or exclamation marks to emphasize titles. Avoid making claims about
the greatness of an article; submitting it implies you find it significant.

## Source Crediting

Always submit content from the original source. If an article references content from another site, opt to submit the
source material directly.

## Promotional Content

While it's acceptable to occasionally post your own content, avoid using this platform primarily for promotional
purposes. The main focus should be to cater to curiosity and interest of the group.
